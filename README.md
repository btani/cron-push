# cron-push
This script allows you to automate the push of a folder every 3600s. The script also allows you to perform a push when you "log off"

**NB: The "cron-push" folder must be entered if you are interested in pushing.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes will be applied at the next login.**

After the download launch the **config.sh** file

To change the time from 3600s to 'any other', go to **chrono-push.sh** and change the time of the sleep function
